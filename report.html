</ol>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The newly designed website will be made public for one month so that the increase in number of members would only be attributed to the refurbished website design .<br>
At the end of every month, the number of new members and tickets, number of website visiter, CTR,... will be counted and compared to the previous month's results.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>TCMC website "specialize in diversity" and as the theme changes for each concert, so the target audience changes as according to the theme.The typical audience may include people with specialised tastes, e.g. classical, jazz, ethnic music, etc. If children are involved, then parents and family members predominate.<br>
This will suit the preferences for each concerts's target audience.</p></p>

<p>- Irfan Shaik - jc488483</p>
<p>Worked on the artist pages which involved the main page featuring all the artists in one main page and 9 other detail pages of the artists.<br>
  The main artist page involves two categories such as featured artists &amp; the other in the &lsquo;List &amp; Grid&rsquo; format. Here it features the band name and a brief introduction of the artists is presented. From here one can directly go to the artist&rsquo;s page of their liking when one will click on the artist.<br>
  For this page, we have trimmed down the image size so that all the pics are of same size in width &amp; height and formatted to have a better look when changed from list to grid &amp; back again. <br>
  In the individual pages, we have given the breadcrumb navigation of which page we are in with the main heading featuring the name of the page and the second heading with introductory line. Later the brief details of the artists. Added any contact details of the artists.<br>
  For the image we have used a float property to keep on the left &amp; border-radius property so as to have a sleek cut image in the borders.<br>
  The header &amp; footer of the all this artists pages follows the rest of the pages illustrating contact details, CTA&rsquo;s, search bar etc.</p>
